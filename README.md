# DL-on-EEG
In this code I use EEG data that has been recoreded for 5 seconds when ask participants to move their right or left hand.
I have implemented a DL on this data using Keras to predict the answer to this question: "Which one of the participants' hand is going to move?"
This data is little (291 sample) and training the model needs to train about 18 million parameters. So the accuracy is low and other classification solutions 
should be implemented.
